# SignLearn

SignLearn allows translation from Sign Language to text

## Testing of the app

1. Once the app is loaded into your phone, disconnect your phone from your computer
2. Exit the app, and then reenter the app
3. This reduces the lag as the phone does not need to log contents and errors back to the PC.
