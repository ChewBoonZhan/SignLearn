# SignLearn

SignLearn allows translation from Sign Language to text

## Testing of the app

1. Once the app is loaded into your phone, disconnect your phone from your computer
2. Exit the app, and then reenter the app
3. This reduces the lag as the phone does not need to log contents and errors back to the PC.

## Update on how the file contents are initially saved

1. If the file contents of how they are initially saved are changed (SharedPreferences), the effects will not take place immediately.
2. You will need to go to settings and clear the app data in order to see the effect taking place
